Getting Started with Git & GitHub

A beginner-friendly guide to connect your local system to a GitHub repository

Version control is essential for managing project changes efficiently. This guide explains how to set up Git, initialize a local repository, and push files to a GitHub repository using standard Git commands.

# Understanding the Four Stages of Git

Git works through the following stages:

Working Directory – Where you create and modify files

Staging Area – Files selected/prepared for commit

Commit Area (Local Repository) – Snapshot of your staged files

Remote Repository – GitHub (cloud storage for your code)

# Step 1 — Install Git

Download and install Git for Windows:
# https://git-scm.com/install/windows

# Step 2 — Create a Local Repository

Create a folder (example: git_github)

Right-click inside the folder → Open Git Bash Here

Enable viewing hidden items to check the .git folder later

# Step 3 — Configure Git (One-time Setup)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --list

# Step 4 — Initialize Git & Add Files
git init
git status

Create a new file

Create newfile.txt inside your folder, then run:

git add newfile.txt
git status
git commit -m "Added newfile.txt"

Modify & add more files

Update newfile.txt

Create another file: textfile2.txt

Add and commit both together:

git add .
git commit -m "Updated newfile.txt and added textfile2.txt"
git log

# Step 5 — Connect Local Repo to GitHub

Before running these commands:

## Login to GitHub
## Create a new repository
## Copy the HTTPS URL of the repo

Then connect:

git remote add origin <your-repo-link>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Result

Your files (newfile.txt and textfile2.txt) are now uploaded to GitHub without manually uploading anything.
Everything was pushed through Git's virtual connection between your local system and GitHub.
